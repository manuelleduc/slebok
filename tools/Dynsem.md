# Dynsem

## Description

DynSem supports concise specification of reduction rules by providing
implicit build and match coercions based on reduction arrows and implicit term constructors. DynSem supports modular specification by adopting implicit propagation of semantic components from I-MSOS,
which allows omitting propagation of components such as environments and stores from rules that do not affect those. DynSem supports the declaration of native operators for delegation of aspects of the semantics to an external definition or implementation. DynSem supports the definition of auxiliary meta-functions , which can be expressed using regular reduction rules and are subject to semantic component propagation. DynSem specifications are executable through
automatic generation of a Java-based AST interpreter
