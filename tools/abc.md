## Description

abc is a complete implementation of AspectJ (with some, mostly minor, differences to the original ajc compiler) that aims to make it easy to implement both extensions and optimisations of the core language. It is built on the Polyglot framework for extensible Java compilation and the Soot framework for Java optimisation.

For developers, abc offers:

- Fast code
- Alternative error messages
- Support through email lists and public bugzilla

For researchers, abc offers:

- An extensible frontend based on Polyglot
- An extensible backend based on Soot
- An ideal platform for experiments with new features and optimisations
